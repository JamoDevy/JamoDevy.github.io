Well this was a little bit of excitement, fun, frustration, confusion, and a lot of screen time all jumbled together. Building this project was awesome because as it's the first, I got to see how the fundementals of what we've been learning during this first module come together. I'll admit I fell behind a bit toward the end and had to cover a few labs after beginning work on the first project but didn't feel inadequet. The fun part for me was definitely in the beginning when our cohort starting to go over exactly what our project was going to entail. 

Once we learned about APIs and touched a little on scraping I was also getting a lot more comfortable with my local environment. It was difficult at first following along. I use VScode on Windows but a lot of my peers and the video lessons use ATOM. So the different environments have a few minor differences but eventually I was able to understand how to navigate (and surprisingly so I think I prefer VScode, but in the future I'm going to try ATOM maybe once I get caught up). Around this time I was excited to dive in and see my work come to life on the terminal.

The easiest part of this project for me was picking what I wanted to create. I needed an API source that was well known, public (so I didnt need a key), and decently full of facts I could pull. I decided to search for a Star Wars API because well, who doesnt like or at least know about Star Wars? At first I thought finding this API was a piece of cake. I recognized the documentation. It was already formatted in JSON. Things looked clear but man was I wrong. Some of the hardest challenges I've faced learning code mostly has to do with the really fine details. Learning Ruby and its functions are very mathematical and easy for me to understand but inputting the right syntax has been bonkers. Learning that sometimes the template isnt always so stripped down or in exact lesson form has been challenging. Paying attention to detail I feel is key. So when I was writing the code for the APIService to fetch the items (people, vehicles, planets, starships) it took a little while to get a couple of the lines working how I needed. My 'fetch_by_name' methods took some time to create simply because the BASE URL was not what I needed (I blame that one on the API).
Unfortunately some of the data on the API wasn't as easily accessible either as in there would be a url inside the object for redirection, which simply made me change the attributes I decided to pull. Instead of someones homeworld I chose more details about them as a person like their height and eye color.

Creating the menu and menu navigation of the program was a piece of cake. If anything it was simply using the base knowledge I had of defining methods and variables and using the if, else, and elsif statements coinciding with the user input. Incorporating integers and functions to puts out prompts for the user was easy. Once I had my APIService file working the program worked like a charm and I began to clean up the code a bit. 

Overall learning how to incorporate the API was the biggest challenge, but it was more because of the API itself. I choose one that had its information stored in a weird format but it helped me learn how to pull information better. Not everything is right out there in the front sometimes you gotta dig a little and the more I learn and practice the better coder/programmer I become.
