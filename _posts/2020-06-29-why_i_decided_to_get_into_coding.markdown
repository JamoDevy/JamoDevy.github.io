Computers have always fascinated me from a young age. To be honest, it was the games that caught me. Even playing solitaire was awesome. I was shown an RTS game 'Age of Empires' by one of my best friends at the time and had to have it. My family had a family desktop computer only used for emails and boring stuff so I learned how to install the game. From then on I started using the computer all the time just surficing the web. I had an AIM account (which was HUGE right before mySpace haha). I continued to explore how computers worked and functioned, as well as adding more and more games to my library. 

If you know anything about gaming on a computer, you know you cant run a very complex game with alot of effects on a regular old standard desktop. This propelled me to learn how to build computers from scratch (and involved many trips to Microcenter). Well, not from scratch scratch, but upgrading I guess. Installing more RAM or a new graphics card, kinda big things for a 12 year old with no idea what he's doing. I learned how to wipe and re-install Windows onto a PC around that age too which I thought was pretty cool at the time. When I started Junior High I actually wanted to be a computer engineer when I grew up. Geek Squad at Best Buy was like a dream job for me. As I grew older through highschool and college I drifted more and more towards gaming and moved to having a console though.

So what brought me back to this side of the tech world? Honestly it is a career move for me. Coding is a language that is forever evolving. Programming allows us to create so much and broadcast so many things its like a massive digital playground. To learn how things work behind the scenes is something I am always intrigued to do. This day and age the demand for software engineers is sky-rocketing. Having this skill would allow the use of so many cool tools and resources to build/create so many things. Trouble shooting and debugging code for others provides an awesome sense of community because a breakthrough for one is a breakthrough for all. Having a job in coding and being able to utilize my own personal problem solving techniques and be good at it sounds like a good move to me. I'm actually a very mathematical person and I'm enjoying what I've learned so far. I'm looking forward to continuing this journey (I can't believe it's only been two weeks!).
